        Probably the <br> most effective <br> way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a
        topic sentence.
    </p>


    <p>
        Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific
        main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the
        paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic
        sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas
        a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic
        sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs,
        generally don’t have topic sentences.
